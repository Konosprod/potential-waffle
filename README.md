I just wanted to try a bit of lua. 

So I made a downloader. This one is for Inuyasha, on a random website. I used :

- lua-gumbo
- luafilesystem
- luasec

It creates directories containing the images. I wanted to create a PDF from them, but all lib are outdate.
I'll find a way to do it, maybe.

## How to use

`lua main.lua https://inuyashamanga.com/`
